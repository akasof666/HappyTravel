Happy Travel 🌍

This is a basic travel website made as a practice project using only HTML and CSS. It’s not connected to any backend — just a simple frontend layout.

🧰 Tech stack

HTML5
CSS3
Google Fonts

📄 Pages & Sections

Homepage with:
Navigation bar
Hero section with a background image and CTA
Destinations section with 3 featured cards
Contact form (non-functional)
Footer
📱 Responsiveness

The layout is mainly designed for desktop. It’s not fully responsive yet, but I plan to improve that later.

🎨 Design

I used soft colors and clean typography:

Fonts: Josefin Sans and Nunito
Color palette: light green, orange, and beige tones

🚧 Still to improve

Make it responsive
Add more pages (e.g. About, Blog)
Connect the contact form with a backend or email service
